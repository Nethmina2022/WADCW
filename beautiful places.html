        <p style="color: aliceblue;" style="position: relative; left: 50px; top: 50px;"> According to the ancient Sri Lankan chronicle the Cūḷavaṃsa, this area was a large forest, then after storms and landslides<br>
             it became a hill and was selected by King Kashyapa (AD 477–495) for his new capital. He built his palace on top of this rock<br>
             and decorated its sides with colourful frescoes. On a small plateau about halfway up the side of this rock he built a gateway<br>
             in the form of an enormous lion. The name of this place is derived from this structure; Sīnhāgiri, the Lion Rock.<br>
             The capital and the royal palace were abandoned after the king's death. It was used as a Buddhist monastery until the 14th century.<br>
             Sigiriya today is a UNESCO listed World Heritage Site. It is one of the best preserved examples of ancient urban planning<br>

        <p style="color: aliceblue;" style="position: relative; left: 50px; top: 50px;"> Sinharaja is a Rain Forest and a biodiversity hotspot which is located in south west lowland wet zone
            within Sabaragamu and Southern provinces of Sri Lanka. Sinharaja rain forest is the country’s last viable
            area of primary tropical rain forest. It covers an area of 11,000 Ha of primary and secondary forests. 
            This narrow strip of rolling site comprises of a series of ridges and valleys. More than 60% of the trees are 
            endemic to Sinharaja Forest and many of them are considered rare. There is much endemic wildlife, especially birds 
            but the reserve is also home to over 50% of Sri Lanka’s endemic species of butterflies & mammals and also many kinds of insects,
            reptiles and rare amphibians. This is one of the main reasons that UNESCO declared Sinharaja Forest as a UNESCO World Heritage in 1988
            under the name of Sinharaja Forest Reserve. In 1936 Sinharaja Forest was first recognized as being the only considerable patch of
            virgin tropical rain forest in the Island.
