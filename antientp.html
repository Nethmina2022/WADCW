        <p style="color: aliceblue;" style="position: relative; left: 50px; top: 50px;"> According to the ancient Sri Lankan chronicle the Cūḷavaṃsa, this area was a large forest, then after storms and landslides<br>
             it became a hill and was selected by King Kashyapa (AD 477–495) for his new capital. He built his palace on top of this rock<br>
             and decorated its sides with colourful frescoes. On a small plateau about halfway up the side of this rock he built a gateway<br>
             in the form of an enormous lion. The name of this place is derived from this structure; Sīnhāgiri, the Lion Rock.<br>
             The capital and the royal palace were abandoned after the king's death. It was used as a Buddhist monastery until the 14th century.<br>
             Sigiriya today is a UNESCO listed World Heritage Site. It is one of the best preserved examples of ancient urban planning<br>
